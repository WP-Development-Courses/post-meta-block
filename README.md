# Post Meta Block - Example

## What is this?

This is a code example to show how to display post meta in the block editor.

## How to use this in my project?

1. Clone the code, cd into the directory, then run `npm install && npm run build`.
2. Go into `index.php`, and adapt the meta key in `wpdc_post_meta_example_block_render` to your project.
3. Activate the plugin, and add a `WPDC - Post Meta Block Example` block to a single post.

## I wish I knew more about custom block development

I'd be happy to teach you custom block development in the [Block Development Bootcamp](https://wpdevelopment.courses/courses/block-development-bootcamp/).
